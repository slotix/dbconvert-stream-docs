## What is DBConvert Streams?

Configuring real-time data replication software typically requires specialized technical knowledge in database management, networking, and system administration. A professional database administrator (DBA) or a DevOps engineer can configure real-time data replication software using their knowledge of DB replication concepts.Â 

DBConvert Streams simplifies this process, making it accessible to users with basic knowledge of database administration. The software handles many technical aspects of configuring and optimizing the replication process behind the scenes, allowing users to focus on selecting the source and target databases and configuring a few key options. 

This streamlined approach can save time and reduce the need for specialized technical expertise, making it an ideal solution for organizations that require real-time data synchronization without the resources to hire expensive DBAs or DevOps engineers.

DBConvert Streams is a set of distributed services that capture row-level changes in a source database, allowing your applications to respond to those data changes with very low latency.

DBS collects data from and deliver data _continuously_ to SQL and no-SQL databases, data warehouses, and files on your premises or in a cloud.

The DBS platform collects its internal metrics in Prometheus format to explore and visualize live data in dashboards.
