![Transaction Log Change Data Capture](/images/log-cdc.png)

**Change Data Capture (CDC)** is a technology that extracts row-level events from Database Transaction Logs generated by the database engine. 

Unfortunately, there is no single API or universal way to do this for all databases. Each database stores transaction logs differently.  

DBConvert Streams can read Postgres WAL logs for PostgreSQL databases and MySQL Binlog files for MySQL databases. DBS extracts data changes on a source and generates `INSERT,` `UPDATE,` and `DELETE` events for consumption. 

By retrieving data changes in real-time from transaction logs, DBConvert Streams minimizes the impact on the source database and provides the information to the target even before the source database finishes processing transactions. For more information on CDC technology, refer to the [Change Data Capture](https://dbconvert.com/blog/change-data-capture-cdc-what-it-is-and-how-it-works/#transaction-log-cdc) article on the DBConvert blog.

DBConvert Streams is a distributed CDC platform that continuously monitors various databases and enables other applications to utilize the collected data. 

## Supported CDC Source Database Types

DBConvert Streams currently supports the following sources:

- MySQL Binlog or MariaDB Binlog
- Amazon RDS for MySQL
- Amazon Aurora (MySQL Compatible)
- PostgreSQL WAL or CockroachDB WAL
- Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL
- Amazon Aurora (PostgreSQL Compatible)

Sources are defined and configured using a simple set of properties in JSON format.
