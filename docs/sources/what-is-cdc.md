![Transaction Log Change Data Capture](/images/log-cdc.png)

**Change data capture** is a technology that retrieves row-level events from Database Transaction Logs generated by a Database engine. 

Traditionally, RDBMS systems use transaction logs for backup and recovery purposes. But they can also be used to replicate changes to target databases.

DBConvert Stream extracts data changes from transaction logs in real-time in order to make information available before the DBMS has finished processing it. At the same this approach minimizes the impact on production database as no additional queries are required for each transaction.

All of the database readers discussed in this Change Data Capture Guide capture change data by reading logs.

See the [Change data capture article](https://dbconvert.com/blog/change-data-capture-cdc-what-it-is-and-how-it-works/#transaction-log-cdc) in our blog for an overview.
